The purpose of the program is to have functions over multiple programs in an effort for them to work together (instead of getting them to work together in the same file).

Lastly, this program will be tracked with Git in order to become more familiar with it.

stretch goals: 

use a makefile

Instructions:

compile main.cpp and run the executable.
